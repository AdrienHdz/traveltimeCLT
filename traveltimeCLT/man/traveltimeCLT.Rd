\title{Travel time estimation modeling using Central Limit Theorem}
\usage{
traveltimeCLT(
  data.train = NULL,
  M = NULL,
  L = NULL,
  bin = NULL,
  rules = NULL,
  data.timebins = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.train}{A dataframe that will be used to construct the graph.}

\item{M}{The number of samples to use from the train set. It is usefull especially when applying the travel time estimation algorithm on a specific time-bin.}

\item{L}{A parameter allowing to remove edges that have not enough observations in the train set.}

\item{bin}{Sample the dataset by a specific time-bin.}

\item{rules}{A list containing, start, end, days and tag for each timebin of the dataset (see example).}

\item{data.timebins}{A vector of strings that represent the different timebins of the dataset.}
}
\description{
This function allows to create the graph of the network and run the algorithm on the train set to get the mean of the autocorrelation and the mean of the residuals.
}
\examples{
traveltimeCLT(data.train = train, M = 1000, L = 2, bin = "MR", rules = list(list(start='6:30', end= '9:00', days = 0:6, tag='MR'),list(start='15:00', end= '18:00', days = 0:6, tag='ER'), data.timebins = c("MR", "ER", "Other")))
