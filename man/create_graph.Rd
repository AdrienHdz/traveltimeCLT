\title{This function allows to create the graph of the network and run the algorithm on the train set to get the mean of the autocorrelation and the mean of the residuals.}
\usage{
create_graph(data.train = NULL, L = NULL, data.timebins = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.train}{Train dataset}

\item{L}{A parameter allowing to remove edges that have not enough observations in the train set.}

\item{data.timebins}{A vector of strings that represent the different time-bins of the dataset.}
}
